# Stripe Payment Demo (Backend-Only)

This project demonstrates a **Stripe integration** using **Spring Boot** where users can register, save their cards
securely, and make payments either through **Stripe Checkout** or via **saved cards** (off-session payments).

## What You Can Do

This backend project allows you to:

### 1. Register Users

- Each user is registered in your system and also created in **Stripe** as a `Customer`.
- A `stripeCustomerId` is stored so we can attach payment methods and charge later.

### 2. Save Cards Securely

- Users save cards using `paymentMethodId` (collected via Stripe Elements on frontend).
- The backend attaches the card to the user‚Äôs Stripe customer and stores basic metadata like `last4`, `brand`, etc.
- This way, we **never handle raw card info** ‚Äî we stay PCI-compliant and safe.

### 3. List & Delete Saved Cards

- Users can view all their saved cards.
- Cards can also be deleted (they're detached from the Stripe customer).

## Two Ways to Pay

---

### 1. Stripe Checkout ‚Äì One-Time Purchase (No Card Saving)

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/payment/checkout`  
**Flow:**

- Accepts a product (name, quantity, price).
- Creates a Stripe **Checkout Session**.
- Returns a session URL ‚Üí redirect user to Stripe‚Äôs secure page.
- User completes payment there.
- After success/failure, Stripe redirects to `/success` or `/cancel`.

**Use Case:** When you want **Stripe to handle UI** and **you don‚Äôt store cards**.

### 2. Charge with Saved Card ‚Äì One-Click Backend Payment

**Endpoint:** `POST /api/payment/charge`  
**Flow:**

- User selects a previously saved card.
- You send `userId`, `cardId`, and `amount` to backend.
- Stripe processes the charge immediately ‚Äî **no user interaction**.

---

## Security First

You should **never send raw card details** (`cardNumber`, `expMonth`, `cvc`, etc.) to your backend.  
Stripe provides frontend libraries (like Stripe.js or Elements) that securely tokenize the card and return a
`paymentMethodId`.

In this project, you‚Äôll see a class called `CardRequest` with raw card fields ‚Äî but this is only for demo/explanation
purposes. You should not use this in real apps.

## Stripe Test Cards

To simulate payments:

| Card Number           | Result     | Notes                   |
|-----------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| `4242 4242 4242 4242` | ‚úÖ Success  | Most common test card   |
| `4000 0000 0000 9995` | ‚ùå Declined | Simulate failed payment |

Use any 3-digit CVC and any future expiration date.
